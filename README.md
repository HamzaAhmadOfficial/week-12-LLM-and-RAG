# LLM RAG System — Intelligent Document QA & Semantic Search

A complete implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline that combines:

* Pre-trained Transformers (GPT-2, BERT)
* Semantic Search with Embeddings
* FAISS Vector Indexing
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Flask API for real-time interaction

This project demonstrates how modern AI systems move beyond static models to context-aware, knowledge-grounded intelligent systems.

## Key Features

* Text generation using GPT-2
* Fill-mask predictions using BERT
* Question answering with transformer pipelines
* Semantic search using sentence embeddings
* Fast similarity search using FAISS
* RAG pipeline for context-aware answers
* REST API with Flask
* Basic conversational memory support
